`Triangle` is a small package for drawing basic triangles in `SwiftUI`.

`Triangle`s can be drawn with automatically evenly-distributed lines and angles, or with specific angles set. Alternatively, they can be drawn with the upper vertex a relative distance across the top edge of the frame. 

All triangles are drawn right-side up, with 1 side flat on the bottom of the frame. This is to eliminate any extra coordinate-based complications. If you need to manipulate them in a more complex way, all of `SwiftUI`'s `View`, `Shape`, and `InsettableShape` modifiers are at your disposal to scale, rotate, move, and more.
